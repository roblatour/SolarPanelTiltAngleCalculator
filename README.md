# Solar Panel Tilt Angle Calculator

Rob Latour, 2024

## Project outline

An excel spreadsheet to calculate optimum solar panel tilt angles

## Features

Just enter:
- the latitude at which the solar panels will be placed
- the year for which you would like the numbers generated
- the time (hours and minutes) for which you would like the positioning optimize (for example 12 hours and 0 minutes for noon)
  (note: time isn't adjusted for Day Light Savings Time should that apply in your location)
- the number of decimal places you would like reported (for example 1 to have an angle like 38.2 reported)

Note: while the spread sheet is protected to prevent inadvertent changes to the formulas, it is not password protected so you can simply remove the protection if you like (Review - Unprotect Sheet).   Similarly, there are some hidden columns and rows, but again you can unhide them if you like.
